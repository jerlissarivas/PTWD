# LAB | JS Basic Algorithms 

Welcome to your first bootcamp exercise at Ironhack!

The goal of this exercise is to get you familiarized with the different data structures we have in JavaScript.

Ready?

## Introduction

For this **pair-programming** activity we are going to use a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop). You can find a REPL that runs in the browser for programming languages as JavaScript in [https://repl.it/languages/nodejs](https://repl.it/languages/nodejs)

Ready to start?

## Requirements

- Go to [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/nodejs) and create an account (or login if you have one)
- Type this in the *Code Editor* (left panel)

  ```javascript
  console.log("I'm ready!");
  ```
- Press `run â–º`
- If you can see the message in the right side panel, you are really ready!

## Instructions

### Iteration 1: Names and Input

  1.1 Create a variable `hacker1` with the driver's name.

  1.2 Print `"The driver's name is XXXX"`.

  1.3 Create a variable `hacker2` with the navigator's name.

  1.4 Print `"The navigator's name is YYYY"`.

### Iteration 2: Conditionals

  2.1. Depending on which name [is longer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length), print:
	  - `The Driver has the longest name, it has XX characters` or 
	  - `Yo, navigator got the longest name, it has XX characters` or
	  - `Wow, you both got equally long names, XX characters!`

### Iteration 3: Loops

  3.1 Print all the characters of the driver's name, separated by a space and [in capitals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase)
  i.e. `"J O H N"`
  
  3.2 Print all the characters of the navigator's name, in reverse order. 
  i.e. `"nhoJ"`
  
  3.3 Depending on the [lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order) of the strings, print:
    - `The driver's name goes first.`
    - `Yo, the navigator goes first definitely.`
    - `What?! You both got the same name?`

### Bonus Time!

Go to [lorem ipsum generator](http://www.lipsum.com/) and:
  - Generate 3 paragraphs. Store the text in a variable type of string.
  - Make your program count the number of words in the string.
  - Make your program count the number of times the Latin word [`et`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/et#Latin) appears.
